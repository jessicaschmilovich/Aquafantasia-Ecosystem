# Aquafantasia-Ecosystem

The Aquafantasia Ecosystem is a Java-based simulation that models an underwater world where mermaids and unicorns interact, breed, and gain power-ups like golden tridents, purple horns, and genie powers. The simulation uses Java Swing for graphical rendering and incorporates object-oriented principles such as inheritance and abstraction to manage creature behaviors, randomized movements, and dynamic interactions within a grid environment.
