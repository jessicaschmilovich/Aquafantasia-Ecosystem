# Aquafantasia-Ecosystem
The Aquafantasia Ecosystem is a Java-based simulation of an underwater world where mermaids and unicorns interact in a grid, gaining power-ups like golden tridents, purple horns, or genie powers. The project uses randomization, object-oriented principles, and Java Swing for grid implementation and graphics. This was a group-based school project.
